# A loop programming exercise - Display Canlendar

- Write a program that takes as input the number of days in a month and the day of the week on which the first of the month occurs. 

- The program should produce a display of the calendar for that month in standard form. 

- For example, if there are 30 days in the month and the first day of the month is Wednesday, the input would be 30 and Wed, and the output should be similar to the following:

  ```
  Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat 
              1   2   3   4
  5   6   7   8   9   10  11 
  12  13  14  15  16  17  18 
  19  20  21  22  23  24  25 
  26  27  28  29  30

  ```
