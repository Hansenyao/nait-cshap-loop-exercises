# A loop programming exercise - Random Number Game

- Write a program that could be used to play a simple game. 

- The program should first generate a random number between 1 and 100 (research how to create random numbers in your programming language). 

- Once this number has been generated, the program should ask the user to guess the generated number. 

- After each incorrect guess, the program should tell the user whether the guess was too low or too high and ask for another guess. 

- This should continue until the user has found the correct number. 

- The program should then print the number of guesses that the user needed to determine the number.
